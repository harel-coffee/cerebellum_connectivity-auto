    "# Noise ceilings for connectivity models\n",
    "This notebook explains the noise ceilings we can use for the connectivity modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "###  1.Definitions \n",
    "Let $\\mathbf{Y}_i$ be the average data (be it raw time series, or predicted average time series - whichever we are predicting - see Evaluation_simulation) for session $i$. Also let $\\mathbf{X}_i$ the cortical data for that session - and $\\mathbf{W}$ the connectivity weights for the model under question.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. noise ceiling based on cerebellar data only\n",
    "One form of noise ceiling will only depend on the cerebellar data (the prediction target). If each session is composed of the true activity patterns $\\mathbf{U}$ and some noise $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{Y}_1 = \\mathbf{U} +  \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_1$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "and $vU$ signifies the variance of the true signal, whereas $vE$ is the variance of the noise, then the correlation between the two sessions is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$r(\\mathbf{Y}_1,\\mathbf{Y}_2) = \\frac{vU}{\\sqrt{vU+vE}\\sqrt{vU+vE}}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "In turn the noise ceiling (best performance of true model, i.e. the correlation between true signal and measured signal) is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_{ceil1} = r(\\mathbf{U},\\mathbf{Y}_i) = \\frac{vU}{\\sqrt{(vU)}\\sqrt{(vU+vE)}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{vU}}{\\sqrt{vU+vE}}=\\sqrt{r(\\mathbf{Y}_1,\\mathbf{Y}_2)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Noise ceiling based both on cerebellar and cortical data\n",
    "The noise ceiling based on cerebellar data only is somewhat optimistic , as it demands that we know the exactly correct activity profiles for the cerebellar voxel. However, for connectivity models, even if we knew the perfect connectivity weights $\\mathbf(W)$, we would be limited by the uncertainty or noise on the cortical data $\\mathbf{X}$. So, we need to consider the fact that the prediction $\\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X}_i$ has noise variance $vP$, which we can estimate by calculating the the correlation: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$r(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{Y}_1,\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{Y}_2) = \\frac{vU}{\\sqrt{vU+vP}\\sqrt{vU+vP}}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "then the adjusted noise ceiling becomes \n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_{ceil2} = r(\\mathbf{X}_i \\mathbf{W},\\mathbf{Y}_i) = \\frac{vU}{\\sqrt{(vU+vP)}\\sqrt{(vU+vE)}}=\\sqrt{r(\\mathbf{Y}_1,\\mathbf{Y}_2) r(\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{Y}_1,\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{Y}_2)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we don't know the true weights, we can only use the weights from the current model - so the noise ceiling becomes model dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Code implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The module `evaluate` has a function `calculate_reliability` which computes the reliability between the sessions - so the snippet of `eval_models` in the `run` module gets you the reliabilities for the noise ceiling:  "
